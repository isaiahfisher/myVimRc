# MY VIMRC

This is my personal vim configuration. Feel free to use it and to make suggestions.

## NOTES

* I have a ftplugin for .vim files that sets foldmodel to marker.
* To use my vim configurations, you will need to change the backups directory.
  * This setting is located in the 'settings' group at lines 189, 190, and 191.
* If you have suggestions, please make an issue or a pull request.
